# OSMI-Mental-Health-Data-Analysis
Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) is a non-profit organization that aims to understand mental health in the tech sector through the Mental Health in Tech Survey.
OSMI has launched the Mental Health in Tech Survey to gain insights into the mental health experiences and perspectives of those working in the tech industry.
The project aims to classify individuals as having a mental illness or not based on various factors.
It also aims to identify the significant predictors of mental health issues in IT workers using data mining techniques and the OSMI survey and provide insights into improving mental health support in the tech industry by examining demographic factors and the correlation between workplace attitudes towards mental health and the probability of developing a mental health condition.
